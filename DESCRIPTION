Description: This package provides functions to emulate molecular quantitative
    trait locus data and clinical data associated with genetic variants under
    user-specified association patterns. The data can be the result of pure
    simulation or can replicate real datasets supplied by the user (which may
    replace real data when these cannot be shared for diverse privacy reasons).
    The data generation schemes are based on generally accepted principles of
    population genetics (Hardy--Weinberg equilibrium, linkage-disequilibrium,
    natural selection, pleiotropic control, sparsity assumptions). Details in
    H. Ruffieux, A. C. Davison, J. Hager, I. Irincheeva, Efficient inference for
    genetic association studies with multiple outcomes, *Biostatistics*, 2017.
