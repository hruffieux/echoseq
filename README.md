## Overview

**echoseq** is an R package providing functions to emulate molecular
quantitative trait locus data, and clinical data associated with genetic
variants under user-specified association patterns. The data can be
obtained by pure simulation or can replicate real datasets supplied by
the user. Datasets simulated using **echoseq** may replace real datasets
when these cannot be shared for diverse privacy reasons. The data
generation schemes are based on generally accepted principles of
population genetics (Hardyâ€“Weinberg equilibrium, linkage-disequilibrium,
natural selection, pleiotropic control, sparsity assumptions, epigenetic
control, etc).
