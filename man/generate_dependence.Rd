\arguments{
\item{list_snps}{An object of class "list_snps" or "sim_snps" containing
SNPs and their corresponding sample minor allele frequencies. It must be
obtained from the function \code{\link{convert_snps}},
\code{\link{generate_snps}} or \code{\link{replicate_real_snps}}.}

\item{list_phenos}{An object of class "list_phenos" or "sim_phenos"
containing phenotypic data variables, their sample variance and block
structure information. It must be obtained from the function
\code{\link{convert_phenos}}, \code{\link{generate_phenos}} or
\code{\link{replicate_real_phenos}}.}

\item{ind_d0}{A vector of indices specifying the position of the "active"
phenotypes (i.e., which will be associated with at least one SNP). Must
range between 1 and \code{ncol(list_phenos$phenos)}. Must be \code{NULL} if
\code{pat} is supplied.}

\item{ind_p0}{A vector of indices specifying the position of the "active"
SNPs (i.e., which will be associated with at least one phenotype). Must
range between 1 and \code{ncol(list_snps$snps)}. Must be \code{NULL} if
\code{pat} is supplied.}

\item{vec_prob_sh}{If \code{block_phenos} is \code{FALSE} (default), vector
of length 1 or \code{length(ind_p0)} providing the probabilities with which
each active SNP will be associated with an additional active phenotype. If
\code{block_phenos} is \code{TRUE}, the vector must have size between 1 and
\code{ncol(list_phenos$phenos)} and gives the set of probabilities with
which an active SNP is associated with an additional active phenotype is
specific to each phenotypic block. Must be \code{NULL} if \code{pat} is
supplied.}

\item{pat}{Boolean matrix of size \code{ncol(list_snps$snps)} x
\code{ncol(list_phenos$phenos)} which can be supplied to set the association
  pattern, instead of providing \code{ind_d0} and \code{ind_p0}. Must be
  \code{NULL} if \code{ind_d0} and \code{ind_p0} are provided.}

\item{family}{Distribution used to generate the phenotypes. Must be either
"\code{gaussian}" or "\code{binomial}" for binary phenotypes.}

\item{pve_per_snp}{Average proportion of phenotypic variance explained by
each active SNP (for an active phenotype). Must be \code{NULL} if
\code{max_tot_pve} is provided. See Details section.}

\item{max_tot_pve}{Maximum proportion of phenotypic variance explained by the
active SNPs across all phenotypes. Must be \code{NULL} if
\code{pve_per_snp} is provided. See Details section.}

\item{block_phenos}{Boolean for deciding whether the values in
\code{vec_prob_sh} should be randomly selected and assigned differently to
each block of phenotypes (if the phenotypes have no block-correlation
structure, blocks are defined articially and the number of blocks
corresponds to the length of the vector \code{vec_prob_sh}). Default is
\code{FALSE}, no phenotypic block structure is used to create the
association pattern. Not used if \code{pat} is supplied.}

\item{user_seed}{Seed set for reproducibility. Default is \code{NULL}, no
seed set.}
}
\value{
An object of class "\code{sim_data}".
 \item{phenos}{Matrix containing the updated phenotypic data (whose variance
               is now partly explained by genetic effects).}
 \item{snps}{Matrix containing the original SNPs data.}
 \item{beta}{Matrix containing the generated effect sizes between the SNPs
            (rows) and phenotypes (columns).}
 \item{pat}{Matrix of booleans specifying the generated association pattern
            between the SNPs (rows) and phenotypes (columns).}
 \item{pve_per_snp}{Average proportion of phenotypic variance explained by
                    each active SNP (for an active phenotype).}
}
\description{
This function sets the association pattern and the effect sizes between SNP
and phenotype objects previously obtained from the functions
\code{\link{generate_snps}} or \code{\link{replicate_real_snps}}, and
\code{\link{generate_phenos}} or \code{\link{replicate_real_phenos}}. It
therefore adds a genetic contribution to the phenotypic data.
}
\details{
The user can provide using the argument \code{vec_prob_sh} a selection of
probabilities describing the propensity with which a given active SNP (i.e.,
associated with at least one phenotype) will be associated with active
phenotypes (i.e., associated with at least one SNP). If \code{block_phenos}
is \code{FALSE} (default), the association pattern is created independently
of any structure in the phenotype matrix. If \code{block_phenos} is
\code{TRUE}, then if the phenotypes have been generated with some block
correlation structure, this block structure will be used to specify the
correlation pattern, else, if the phenotypes were generated independently one
from another, blocks are defined articially and the number of blocks
corresponds to the length of the vector \code{vec_prob_sh}). More precisely,
for each active SNP and each phenotypic block, a value from this vector is
selected uniformly at random; for instance a large probability implies that
the SNPs is highly likely to be associated with each active phenotype in the
block. If a single value is provided, all active SNPs will have the same
probability to be associated with active phenotypes of all blocks.

The user can provide either argument \code{pve_per_snp}, specifying the
average proportion of phenotypic variance explained per active SNP for a
given active phenotype, or \code{max_tot_pve}, specifying the maximum value
for an active phenotype of its proportion of variance explained by the
cummulated genetic effects. If both \code{pve_per_snp} and \code{max_tot_pve}
are \code{NULL}, the proportion of phenotypic variance explained per SNP is
set to its maximum value so that the total proportion of variance explained
for the phenotypes are all below 1. Individual proportions of variance
explained are drawn from a Beta distribution with shape parameters 2 and 5,
putting more weights on smaller effects.

If family is "\code{binomial}", the phenotypes are generated from a probit
model, and the phenotypic variance explained by the SNPs is with respect to
the latent Gaussian variables involved in the probit model.
