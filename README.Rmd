## echoseq: Faithful replication and simulation of molecular and clinical data

<!-- Run for the R CMD checks, run usethis::use_github_actions() to set up the pipeline, possibly modify the .yaml file and then: -->

## Overview

**echoseq** is an R package providing functions to emulate molecular quantitative
trait locus data, and clinical data associated with genetic variants under
user-specified association patterns. The data can be obtained by pure simulation 
or can replicate real datasets supplied by the user. Datasets simulated using 
**echoseq** may replace real datasets when these cannot be shared for diverse 
privacy reasons. The data generation schemes are based on generally accepted 
principles of population genetics (Hardyâ€“Weinberg equilibrium, 
linkage-disequilibrium, natural selection, pleiotropic control, sparsity 
assumptions, epigenetic control, etc).


## Warning

**This is a development branch**, it is not guaranteed to be stable at any given
time and features are subject to change. Please use the [stable version](https://github.com/hruffieux/echoseq), unless you want to test and
report issues.

## Installation
